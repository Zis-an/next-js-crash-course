FEATURES OF NEXT JS
1. Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

ABOUT NEXT JS
1. There are two types of components in Next Js.
	# Client-Side Components
	# Server-Side Components ( Default Component )

	To make a component a client-side component
		"use client" --> this has to be added at the top of the file

2. Routing
	Next Js use a file based routing system.
	Folders are used to define routes.
	Folder name becomes the route name.
	** Inside the folder, the file called page.tsx gets rendered for that route.
	
	Nested Routes

	Dynamic Routes
	To make dynamic routes
	Have to wrap the folder name into square brackets --> []

	layout.tsx acts as the parent for all routes.

	Route Groups
	To use Route Groups
	Have to wrap the folder name into parenthesis --> ()

3. Error Handling
	Error file which is nearest to the parent error file will be shown always.
	Not all the error files.
	Only the nearest one.
